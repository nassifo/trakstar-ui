Trakstar GUI

### How do I get set up? ###

* Need ChartDirector DLL to compile and Trakstar ATC3DG64.DLL next to main .exe

# To-do #

	Priority:
	- Disable Save As button after recording started
	
	- Investigate why the Q values are what they are... is it a problem? If so, how to fix? Does it have
	- to do with the filters? Do I need to enable filters? Maybe contact NDI about this...
	
	- Investigate why changing sampling freq/ power line freq crashes the program... how to fix?
	
	- Presisting sampling frequency and power line frequency
	
	Less important for now:
	- Compiling everything into one exe (32/64 bit)
