### What is this repository for? ###

Trakstar GUI

### How do I get set up? ###

* Need ChartDirector DLL to compile and Trakstar DLL next to .exe

# To-do #

	Priority:
	- Fix reference frame and hemisphere parameters (pg 198, 205)
	- After ^ add boundary on plot to show the limits of each axis (to show where is outside the box)
	- Better control over file I/O. Need a better control over selecting file to write to, choosing whether to overwrite or create new file, managing multiple files.
	- Timer/Stopwatch on UI to start/stop recording session, this has to work with ^ well
	- Option to select sensors to show on plot (updating the list dynamically, maybe also include sensor Q value)
	- Ability to change the name of each sensor on the UI(e.g. sensor 1 -> left arm)

	Less important for now:
	- Testing program on another computer, compiling everything into one exe (32/64 bit)
	- Fix 3d plot 
	- Adding option to switch between 2d and 3d plot
	- Advanced settings window: sampling rate, power line frequency
