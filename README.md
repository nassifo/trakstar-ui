### What is this repository for? ###

Trakstar GUI

### How do I get set up? ###

* Need ChartDirector DLL to compile and Trakstar DLL next to .exe

# To-do #

	Priority:
	- Fix reference frame and hemisphere parameters (pg 198, 205)
	- With regards to frame of reference maybe using "below" hemisphere is better so Z can never be negative? Ask Vickie
	- Textbox to change viewangle of 3d chart
	- Ask vickie if we need the time series?
	- Add indicator text that a sensor is out of bounds
	- Ability to change the name of each sensor on the UI(e.g. sensor 1 -> left arm) and save to Settings
    
	Less important for now:
	- Testing program on another computer, compiling everything into one exe (32/64 bit)
	- Advanced settings window: sampling rate, power line frequency, see what other settings should be added
